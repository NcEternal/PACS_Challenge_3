- clear instructions for compilation and exectution
- no openmp
- Nuemann boundary conditions implemented
- error decreases with mesh size and is the same for sequential and parallel case
- computational time decreases with number of processes (scalability test ok) if mesh size is sufficiently small

- no need for implementing separate methods for sequential and parallel code, you can write a single function that takes into account the presence of a single rank.:wq
